# ~/dotfiles

My settings for OSX, vim, tmux, version control etc.

This is a fork of [Mathias Bynensâ€™ dotfiles repo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), so his is the one to look at.

In a nutshell:
- Create config files in `~/dotfiles`
- Version control them
- Symlink them with `ln -s ~/dotfiles/.file ~/.file`
